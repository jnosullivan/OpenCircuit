# OpenCircuit

OpenCircuit is an open source (ideally libre) software intitiative to tackle a need a group of college computer science students noticed while taking electronics classes. We aim to create an open source Circuit Drawing/schematic app for iOS that is gratis to users, and open for development to anyone who would like to contribute their time and skill. We are starting this project with two members of Loyola University Chicago's LuTec technology group - John O'Sullivan and August Meyer. Together, we hope to create a better, gratis, open-source alternative to the extremely limited selection of iOS circuit-drawing applications currently available on Apple's iOS App Store. At our initiative's start, we are committed to keeping this app gratis, and improving it with the help of the FLOSS community.
